    <h1>Hyperlinks</h1>
    <p>Helps us navigate from websites to websites or webpages. For example, this is an external link. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">this</a> should open youtube, which is an external link becauese it links to a different website itself</p>
    <p>But if you want to navigate through same websites different pages then you can use an internal link. <a href="externalLink.html">This</a> will transfer you to different page of same website.</p>
    <p>if you want to make some kind of link that will help you navigate different places in same sites then you can use anchor links.</p>
